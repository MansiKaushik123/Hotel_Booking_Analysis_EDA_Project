As further moved i.e Data collection first step is to find different columns which are done by coding head(), tail(), info(), describe(), column (), and some other methods used for data collection, some of the column na,e is updated here i.e hotel,is_canceled,lead_time,arrival_date_year,arrival_date_month,arrival_date_week_number,arrivel_date_day_of_month,stays_in_weekend_nights. As we further moved we find unique value of each column and generate a list in tabular form and also check the dataset type of each columns' find some column not inaccurate data type which corrects it later done in Data cleaning part and as well as duplicates data items must be removed as we find duplicates items equal to 87396 which is dropped from dataset later.
